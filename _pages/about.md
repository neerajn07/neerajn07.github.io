I am a Geophysicist and Ph.D. candidate at Queen’s University, under the guidance of [Dr. Alexander Braun](http://sea-level.org) at the Department of Geological Sciences and Engineering at Queen’s University. My research focuses on UAV-borne Magnetic and Radiometric data using dual-sensor systems for mineral exploration and geological mapping.
I have extensive experience in field data acquisition and data processing, with expertise in:

 * Potential field methods: Gravity, Magnetic and ERT
 * UAV application in mineral exploration: Magnetic, Radiometrics, and Hyperspectral
 * Numerical method: Finite difference method, Spectral infinite element method (SPECFEM)

I completed my master's degree in May 2020 at the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.iitk.ac.in/es/) under the supervision of [Dr. Animesh Mandal](https://sites.google.com/view/animesh-mandal/home), Where I study groundwater modeling using Electrical resistivity tomography.

<!-- Outside academia, I am an avid cyclist and runner, often exploring the scenic routes around Lake Ontario. I also enjoy teaching. -->
